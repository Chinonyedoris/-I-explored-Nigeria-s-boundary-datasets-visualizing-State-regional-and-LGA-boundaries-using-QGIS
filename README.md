This project is part of my Introduction to Geospatial Data Science training with Data Science Nigeria (DSN).
👩‍💻As part of my ongoing training with DSN - Data Science Nigeria(DSN), I worked on a project using QGIS to create a map showing health facility centers across Nigerian states.This exercise was an eye-opener into how geospatial analysis can drive impactful decisions in public health planning, accessibility studies, and resource allocation.#GeospatialDataScience #QGIS #DataScienceNigeria #GIS #Mapping #SpatialAnalysis

## 🌍 Geospatial Data Science in Action with QGIS 🗺️
From this project, I was able to create a map that identifies health centers across all 36 states and regions of Nigeria. ✨ From my Geospatial Analysis project, you can identify health centres across all 36 states and regions of Nigeria, mapped using QGIS.

## This project, part of my training with DSN - Data Science Nigeria(DSN), demonstrates how geospatial tools like QGIS can support public health, policy-making, and data-driven decision processes.
## 💡 One big takeaway: QGIS isn’t just for geographers—it’s a versatile tool for data scientists, analysts, and anyone working with spatial data.
